# Supported, Partially Supported, and Unsupported Tools

Here’s a list of tools and platforms where Opale AI Search Bar works seamlessly, partially works, or is currently unsupported. 

## Supported Tools ✅
- **Gmail**: Write an email
- **GitHub**: README, PR templates, and issues
- **VSCode Online**
- **Slack**
- **Facebook/Messenger/Instagram**
- **Reddit**
- **YouTube**
- ...and many more! (I’ll add more here soon.)

## Partially Supported Tools ⚠️
- **Medium**: The enriched text editor seems to prevent proper input clearing and controlling where the text is inserted. Needs further investigation.
- **Notion**: Similar issue with the enriched editor; it’s tricky to manage precise input interactions. Needs more exploration.
- **Google Sheets**: Works in cells but not in the formula bar (also an enriched editor).


## Unsupported Tools ❌
- **Google Docs**: Uses a canvas-based editor, not a standard web text editor, making interactions challenging. Needs further research.
- **Google Slides**: Similar to Google Docs; the canvas-based design complicates integration.

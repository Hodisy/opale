## Search Bar and Shortcuts

### Accessing the Search Bar
Press **Ctrl + Shift + L** to open or close the search bar. This shortcut can be customized in the Chrome shortcuts settings at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. 

To display the search bar, your cursor must be active in an editable text field such as an `input`, `textarea`, or `contentEditable`. Don't worry—the LLM doesn't pull all the data from your page, only what you explicitly provide in your input.

### Using the Search Bar
Once the bar is displayed, you can type text. If there are relevant results, up to **three top suggestions** will appear. Navigate through these results using the **down arrow** or **Tab key** to move down, and the **up arrow** to move back up.

Clicking anywhere outside the search bar or pressing **Escape** will close the bar automatically.

If the text generation process is taking too long, you can cancel it by pressing **Ctrl + C**.

### Bonus Feature: Saving Prompts
In the prompt editing page, you can save a prompt during creation or modification by pressing **Ctrl + S**, provided the prompt is valid.


## Extension Pages: Home and Edit

### Adding, Editing, or Deleting Prompts
You can:
- **Add, edit, or delete prompts**.
- Select an icon—currently limited to those available in the app (or you can tweak the code or terminal if you're feeling adventurous).
- Give the tool a name.
- Specify a version number in the format `[0-9].[0-9]`. Does this versioning serve a purpose? Honestly, no clue—I didn’t question it.

### Writing Prompts
Define your prompt to explain what you need the assistant to do. This serves as general context for your tasks; you can provide more specific instructions directly in the input field when using the tool.

#### Tips for Writing Prompts:
1. **Build custom tools**: Create prompts for generating other prompts.
2. **Explore prompt engineering**: Experiment with techniques like few-shot learning or chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning for better results (though that's up to you).
3. **Add personal examples**: Include your typical writing style to get more natural results, such as crafting emails with your unique tone.


## Using Your Prompt with the Search Bar on the Web

Go to an app where you typically write text and that supports Opale (`input`, `textarea`, `contentEditable`). For instance:
1. Open your email client.
2. Type a few words about the task you want to perform (e.g., "email to kids about Christmas vacation").
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + L**.
4. Select your email prompt tool with the instructions you’ve given to personalize the tone.
5. Press **Enter**—and voilà! It’s not perfect, but at least you’ve got a starting point. Better than staring at a blank page, right?

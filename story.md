- Introduce collaborative tools to allow teams to share prompts, workflows, and configurations seamlessly.
- Expand compatibility with various AI tools, including client-side APIs for translation, summarization, and more. Leverage advanced AI cloud models through user-provided API keys (e.g., Gemini 1.5) and integrate alternative large language models like GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku, and Mistral’s offerings (e.g., Mistral-small, Codestral).

#### Additional Ideas
- Offer custom agents with advanced workflows, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) supported by server-side memory platforms.
- Explore non-AI enhancements such as script execution, redirection to specific pages, or adding versatile search bar features to streamline user workflows.
